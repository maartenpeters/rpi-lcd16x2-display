## Introduction

The Raspberry Pi LCD Display Project is designed to make it easy for users to showcase interesting and dynamic information on a 16x2 character LCD display connected to a Raspberry Pi. The project leverages Python for the application logic and includes bash scripts for system configuration and setup.

## Features

- Display fun and relevant information on a 16x2 character LCD display.
- Python application for easy customization and extension.
- Bash scripts for simplified Raspberry Pi setup.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your Raspberry Pi:

- Python 3.x
- RPi.GPIO library
- [Adafruit_CharLCD library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_CharLCD)
- Additional dependencies mentioned in `requirements.txt`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/raspberry-pi-lcd-display.git
   cd raspberry-pi-lcd-display
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run setup script:

   ```bash
   bash setup.sh
   ```

## Usage

1. Modify the Python application (`lcd_display.py`) to customize the content displayed on the LCD.
2. Run the Python application:

   ```bash
   python lcd_display.py
   ```

   This will start displaying information on the connected LCD.
